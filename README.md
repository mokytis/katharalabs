# katharalabs

A collection of labs used to simulate various network setups. These labs are
intended to be ran inside using
[Kathara](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara).

## Labs

* [Lab 1: Starting Point](./l001-startingpoint/)

## Disclaimer

I am writing these labs as I'm learning about networking as part of my
[BSc Cyber Security at the University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/education/undergraduate/cyber/).
This means that I am _not_ an expert. If you think something is wrong, or want
to suggest an edit feel free to get in touch, create an issue, or create a
merge request.

## Contributors & Attribution

Currently all content written is my own but in places is heavily inspired by the

true of any articles, blog posts, and other resources that I use (they will also
